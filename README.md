# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

The purpose of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

**Steps to get the tidy data set:**

1) Download the zip file with the required datasets from here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2) Unzip the file.
3) Copy the [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/fedesegui/wearable_computing/blob/master/run_analysis.R) script to the same folder of the unzipped files in step. 
4) Set the working directory (setwd) to the same path of the unzipped files and R script.
5) Run the run_analyisis.R script. The outputs are the files: dscombine.txt and [dstidy.txt](https://github.com/fedesegui/wearable_computing/blob/master/dstidy.txt)
